Initially sold by street vendors, Pho quickly gained popularity, evolving into a beloved comfort food enjoyed by people from all walks of life. Today, it is considered a national dish and an ambassador of Vietnamese cuisine.The Art of Broth:At the heart of any exceptional bowl of Pho is the broth, simmered to perfection with a delicate balance of spices, charred onions, ginger, and beef or chicken bones. The slow-cooking process extracts the essence of the ingredients, resulting in a clear, aromatic broth that forms the foundation of this soul-warming dish. Each family and restaurant has its secret blend of spices, creating a distinctive flavor profile that makes their Pho unique.Rice Noodles and Toppings:The thin, flat rice noodles, or "bánh phở," are a crucial element of Pho, providing a chewy texture that complements the rich broth.
